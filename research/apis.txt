GOVTRACK.US --------------------
http://www.govtrack.us/source.xpd

Bill Search API

Get the results of a bill search in XML using the bill search API. See this example. (There's no other documentation other than the example. As with the search page on this site, append a slash and a number to search previous congresses, like "iraq/109".)

Member of Congress API

Get some information about a Member of Congress in XML using the MoC API. See this example. You can also pass a "session" parameter to get sponsored and cosponsored bills from the current or a previous Congresses, i.e. this example with bills. (There's no other documentation other than the example, and there are no other query string options. On Nov 14, 2008, the API now requires the session parameter to get the list of bills.)

Vote Database API

Get voting records in XML, too. To get an overall list, see the XML download link at the top of the votes page. To include the votes of members of Congress, first find the member, then follow the link to the votes database, and then grab the XML download link.

Congressional District Look-up API

Look up a congressional district by ZIP code (ZIP or ZIP+4) latitude/longitude, or by street address (which uses geocoder.us underlyingly). It'll also tell you the GovTrack IDs for the senators and representatives for the district (as of Nov 14, 2008). Here are four examples: by 5-digit ZIP code (which happens to yield multiple matches but can also return a single match as with the rest of the examples), by 9-digit ZIP code, by address, and by latitude/longitude. Try fake zip codes, addresses, etc. to see what the results look like if no match is found. ZIP+4 lookups is based on USPS data purchased by Public.Resource.Org. I have compactified the ZIP+4 database here so that if all ZIP+4 codes starting with "XYZ" map to the same district, then there is a single entry in the file for "XYZ". (The information in the API and file is current as of Summer 2008.)
