 ``(1) IN GENERAL.--Notwithstanding section 702(b)--
 ``(A) any net income with respect to such interest for any partnership taxable year shall be treated as ordinary income for the performance of services, and
 ``(B) any net loss with respect to such interest for such year, to the extent not disallowed under paragraph (2) for such year, shall be treated as an ordinary loss.

All items of income, gain, deduction, and loss which are taken into account in computing net income or net loss shall be treated as ordinary income or ordinary loss (as the case may be).
 ``(2) TREATMENT OF LOSSES.--
 ``(A) LIMITATION.--Any net loss with respect to such interest shall be allowed for any partnership taxable year only to the extent that such loss does not exceed the excess (if any) of--

 ``(ii) the aggregate net loss with respect to such interest not disallowed under this subparagraph for all prior partnership taxable years.
 ``(B) CARRYFORWARD.--Any net loss for any partnership taxable year which is not allowed by reason of subparagraph (A) shall be treated as an item of loss with respect to such partnership interest for the succeeding partnership taxable year.

 ``(ii) the aggregate net loss with respect to such interest to which paragraph (1)(B) did not apply by reason of this subparagraph for all prior taxable years.

 ``(ii) all items of deduction and loss so taken into account.
 ``(B) NET LOSS.--The term `net loss' means with respect to such interest for such year, the excess (if any) of the amount described in subparagraph (A)(ii) over the amount described in subparagraph (A)(i).
 ``(b) Dispositions of Partnership Interests.--

 ``(B) the aggregate net loss with respect to such interest allowed under subsection (a)(2) for all partnership taxable years.
 ``(3) DISPOSITION OF PORTION OF INTEREST.--In the case of any disposition of an investment services partnership interest, the amount of net loss which otherwise would have (but for subsection (a)(2)(C)) applied to reduce the basis of such interest shall be disregarded for purposes of this section for all succeeding partnership taxable years.
 ``(4) DISTRIBUTIONS OF PARTNERSHIP PROPERTY.--In the case of any distribution of property by a partnership with respect to any investment services partnership interest held by a partner--
 ``(A) the excess (if any) of--
 ``(i) the fair market value of such property at the time of such distribution, over
 ``(ii) the adjusted basis of such property in the hands of the partnership,
shall be taken into account as an increase in such partner's distributive share of the taxable income of the partnership (except to the extent such excess is otherwise taken into account in determining the taxable income of the partnership),
 ``(B) such property shall be treated for purposes of subpart B of part II as money distributed to such partner in an amount equal to such fair market value, and

then subsection (a) shall not apply to the portion of the distributive share that is with respect to invested capital. An allocation will not be treated as reasonable for purposes of this subparagraph if such allocation would result in the partnership allocating a greater portion of income to invested capital than any other partner not providing services would have been allocated with respect to the same amount of invested capital.
 ``(B) SPECIAL RULE FOR DISPOSITIONS.--In any case to which subparagraph (A) applies, subsection (b) shall not apply to any gain or loss allocable to invested capital.

 ``(i) PROCEEDS OF PARTNERSHIP LOANS NOT TREATED AS INVESTED CAPITAL OF SERVICE PROVIDING PARTNERS.--For purposes of this paragraph, an investment services partnership interest shall not be treated as acquired  on account of a contribution of invested capital to the extent that such capital is attributable to the proceeds of any loan or other advance made or guaranteed, directly or indirectly, by any partner or the partnership.
 ``(ii) LOANS FROM NONSERVICE PROVIDING PARTNERS TO THE PARTNERSHIP TREATED AS INVESTED CAPITAL.--For purposes of this paragraph, any loan or other advance to the partnership made or guaranteed, directly or indirectly, by a partner not providing services to the partnership shall be treated as invested capital of such partner and amounts of income and loss treated as allocable to invested capital shall be adjusted accordingly.
 ``(d) Other Income and Gain in Connection With Investment Management Services.--
 ``(1) IN GENERAL.--If--
 ``(A) a person performs (directly or indirectly) investment management services for any entity,
 ``(B) such person holds a disqualified interest with respect to such entity, and
 ``(C) the value of such interest (or payments thereunder) is substantially related to the amount of income or gain (whether or not realized) from the assets with respect to which the investment management services are performed,

any income or gain with respect to such interest shall be treated as ordinary income for the performance of services. Rules similar to the rules of subsection (c)(2) shall apply where such interest was acquired on account of invested capital in such entity.
