 ``(VI) ATTESTATION.--The State requires that an application for medical assistance under this title or for child health assistance under title XXI shall not be complete until the parent or guardian of the child for whose eligibility the State is relying on a finding from an Express Lane agency attests under penalty of perjury that the information provided to verify the citizenship or nationality of the child is accurate, to the best of the parent's or guardian's knowledge.
