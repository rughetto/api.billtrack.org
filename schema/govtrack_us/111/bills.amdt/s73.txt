 ``(a) Termination of Coverage for Nonpregnant Childless Adults.--
 ``(1) NO NEW CHIP WAIVERS; AUTOMATIC EXTENSIONS AT STATE OPTION THROUGH 2009.--Notwithstanding section 1115 or any other provision of this title, except as provided in this subsection--
 ``(A) the Secretary shall not on or after the date of the enactment of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009, approve or renew a waiver, experimental, pilot, or demonstration project that would allow funds made available under this title to be used to provide child health assistance or other health benefits coverage to a nonpregnant childless adult; and
 ``(B) notwithstanding the terms and conditions of an applicable existing waiver, the provisions of paragraph (2) shall apply for purposes of any period beginning on the first day of the first month that begins after the 6-month termination period, in determining the period to which the waiver applies, the individuals eligible to be covered by the waiver, and the amount of the Federal payment under this title.
 ``(2) TERMINATION OF CHIP COVERAGE UNDER APPLICABLE EXISTING WAIVERS 6 MONTHS AFTER THE DATE OF THE ENACTMENT OF THIS ACT.--
 ``(A) IN GENERAL.--No funds shall be available under this title for child health assistance or other health benefits coverage that is provided to a nonpregnant childless adult under an applicable existing waiver after the last day of the 6-month termination period.
 ``(B) EXTENSION UPON STATE REQUEST.--If an applicable existing waiver described in subparagraph (A) would otherwise expire before the date described in paragraph (1)(A), notwithstanding the requirements of subsections (e) and (f) of section 1115, a State may submit, not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, a request to the Secretary for an extension of the waiver. The Secretary shall approve a request for an extension of an applicable existing waiver submitted pursuant
to this subparagraph, but only through the last day of the 6-month termination period.
 ``(C) APPLICATION OF ENHANCED FMAP.--The enhanced FMAP determined under section 2105(b) shall apply to expenditures under an applicable existing waiver for the provision of child health assistance or other health benefits coverage to a nonpregnant childless adult during the 6-month termination period.

 ``(B) DEADLINE FOR APPROVAL.--The Secretary shall make a decision to approve or deny an application for a Medicaid nonpregnant childless adults waiver submitted under subparagraph (A) within 90 days of the date of the submission of the application. If no decision has been made by the Secretary as of the last day of the 6-month termination period, on the application of a State for a Medicaid nonpregnant childless adults waiver that was submitted to the Secretary by the date described in
subparagraph (A), the application shall be deemed approved.
 ``(C) STANDARD FOR BUDGET NEUTRALITY.--The budget neutrality requirement applicable with respect to expenditures for medical assistance under a Medicaid nonpregnant childless adults waiver shall--
 ``(i) in the case of any period of fiscal year 2009 in which such waiver is in effect, allow expenditures for medical assistance under title XIX for all such adults to not exceed the total amount of payments made to the State under paragraph (2)(B) for any previous corresponding period in fiscal year 2009, increased by the percentage increase (if any) in the projected nominal per capita amount of National Health Expenditures for 2009 over 2008, as most recently published by the Secretary;
 ``(ii) in the case of fiscal year 2010, allow expenditures for medical assistance under title XIX for all such adults to not exceed the sum of the total amount of payments made to the State under paragraph (2)(B) for fiscal year 2009 and under title XIX for any period of fiscal year 2009 in which such waiver is in effect, increased by the percentage increase (if any) in the projected nominal per capita amount of National Health Expenditures for 2010 over 2009, as most recently published by the
Secretary; and
 ``(iii) in the case of any succeeding fiscal year, allow such expenditures to not exceed the amount in effect under this subparagraph for the preceding fiscal year, increased by the percentage increase (if any) in the projected nominal per capita amount of National Health Expenditures for the calendar year that begins during the year involved over the preceding calendar year, as most recently published by the Secretary.
 ``(4) 6-month TERMINATION PERIOD.--In this subsection, the term ``6-month termination period'' means the period that begins with the first day of the first month that begins on or after the date of enactment of this Act and ends on the last day of the 5th succeeding month.
