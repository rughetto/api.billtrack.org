SA 47. Mr. COBURN (for himself and Mr. THUNE) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill H.R. 2, to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to extend and improve the Children's Health Insurance Program, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:


 On page 153, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:
 (c) Required Offering of Premium Assistance for Coverage of Children Through Private Plans Under SCHIP and Medicaid if the State Expands Their Program Beyond Current Eligibility Levels.--
 (1) IN GENERAL.--Section 2105(c) (42 U.S.C. 1397ee(c)), as amended by section 601, is amended by adding at the end the following:
 ``(12) REQUIRED OFFERING OF PREMIUM ASSISTANCE.--
 ``(A) IN GENERAL.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the child health assistance provided to any child whose family income exceeds the income eligibility level in effect under the State children's plan as of January 1, 2009, shall consist of a State premium assistance subsidy (as defined in subparagraph (C)) for qualified coverage (as defined in subparagraph (B)) in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph.
 ``(B) QUALIFIED COVERAGE.--In this paragraph, the term `qualified coverage' means the following:
 ``(i) QUALIFIED EMPLOYER SPONSORED COVERAGE.--
 ``(I) IN GENERAL.--A group health plan or health insurance coverage offered through an employer that is--
 ``(aa) substantially equivalent to the benefits coverage in a benchmark benefit package described in section 2103(b) or benchmark-equivalent coverage that meets the requirements of section 2103(a)(2);
 ``(bb) made similarly available to all of the employer's employees and for which the employer makes a contribution to the premium that is not less for employees receiving a premium assistance subsidy under any option available under the State child health plan under this title or the State plan under title XIX to provide such assistance than the employer contribution provided for all other employees; and
 ``(cc) cost-effective, as determined under subclause (II).
 ``(II) COST-EFFECTIVENESS.--A group health plan or health insurance coverage offered through an employer shall be considered to be cost-effective if--
 ``(aa) the marginal premium cost to purchase family coverage through the employer is less than the State cost of providing child health assistance through the State child health plan for all the children in the family who are targeted low-income children; or
 ``(bb) the marginal premium cost between individual coverage and purchasing family coverage through the employer is not greater than 175 percent of the cost to the State to provide child health assistance through the State child health plan for a targeted low-income child.
 ``(ii) QUALIFIED NON-GROUP COVERAGE.--Health insurance coverage offered to individuals in the non-group health insurance market that is substantially equivalent to the benefits coverage in a benchmark benefit package described in section 2103(b) or benchmark-equivalent coverage that meets the requirements of section 2103(a)(2).
 ``(iii) HIGH DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLAN.--A high deductible health plan (as defined in section 223(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) purchased through a health savings account (as defined under section 223(d) of such Code).
 ``(C) PREMIUM ASSISTANCE SUBSIDY.--
 ``(i) IN GENERAL.--In this paragraph, the term `premium assistance subsidy' means, with respect to a targeted low-income child, the amount equal to the difference between the employee contribution required for enrollment only of the employee under qualified employer sponsored coverage and the employee contribution required for enrollment of the employee and the child in such coverage, less any applicable premium cost-sharing applied under the State child health plan, subject to the annual
aggregate cost-sharing limit applied under section 2103(e)(3)(B).
 ``(ii) STATE PAYMENT OPTION.--Subject to clause (iii), a State may provide a premium assistance subsidy directly to an employer or as reimbursement to an employee for out-of-pocket expenditures.
 ``(iii) REQUIREMENT FOR DIRECT PAYMENT TO EMPLOYEE.--A State shall not pay a premium assistance subsidy directly to the employee, unless the State has established procedures to ensure that the targeted low-income child on whose behalf such payments are made are actually enrolled in the qualified employer sponsored coverage.
 ``(iv) TREATMENT AS CHILD HEALTH ASSISTANCE.--Expenditures for the provision of premium assistance subsidies shall be considered child health assistance described in paragraph (1)(C) of subsection (a) for purposes of making payments under that subsection.
 ``(v) STATE OPTION TO REQUIRE ACCEPTANCE OF SUBSIDY.--A State may condition the provision of child health assistance under the State child health plan for a targeted low-income child on the receipt of a premium assistance subsidy for enrollment in qualified employer sponsored coverage if the State determines the provision of such a subsidy to be more cost-effective in accordance with subparagraph (B)(ii).
 ``(vi) NOT TREATED AS INCOME.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a premium assistance subsidy provided in accordance with this paragraph shall not be treated as income to the child or the parent of the child for whom such subsidy is provided.
 ``(D) NO REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL COVERAGE FOR BENEFITS AND ADDITIONAL COST-SHARING PROTECTION PROVIDED UNDER THE STATE CHILD HEALTH PLAN.--
 ``(i) IN GENERAL.--A State that elects the option to provide a premium assistance subsidy under this paragraph shall not be required to provide a targeted low-income child enrolled in qualified employer sponsored coverage with supplemental coverage for items or services that are not covered, or are only partially covered, under the qualified employer sponsored coverage or cost-sharing protection other than the protection required under section 2103(e)(3)(B).
 ``(ii) NOTICE OF COST-SHARING REQUIREMENTS.--A State shall provide a targeted low-income child or the parent of such a child (as appropriate) who is provided with a premium assistance subsidy in accordance with this paragraph with notice of the cost-sharing requirements and limitations imposed under the qualified employer sponsored coverage in which the child is enrolled upon the enrollment of the child in such coverage and annually thereafter.
 ``(iii) RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS.--A State may require a parent of a targeted low-income child that is enrolled in qualified employer-sponsored coverage to bear the responsibility for keeping track of out-of-pocket expenditures incurred for cost-sharing imposed under such coverage and to notify the State when the limit on such expenditures imposed under section 2103(e)(3)(B) has been reached for a year from the effective date of enrollment for such year.
 ``(iv) STATE OPTION FOR REIMBURSEMENT.--A State may retroactively reimburse a parent of a targeted low-income child for out-of-pocket expenditures incurred after reaching the 5 percent cost-sharing limitation imposed under section 2103(e)(3)(B) for a year.
 ``(E) 6-month WAITING PERIOD REQUIRED.--A State shall impose at least a 6-month waiting period from the time an individual is enrolled in private health insurance prior to the provision of a premium assistance subsidy for a targeted low-income child in accordance with this paragraph.
 ``(F) NON APPLICATION OF WAITING PERIOD FOR ENROLLMENT IN THE STATE MEDICAID PLAN OR THE STATE CHILD HEALTH PLAN.--A targeted low-income child provided a premium assistance subsidy in accordance with this paragraph who loses eligibility for such subsidy shall not be treated as having been enrolled in private health insurance coverage for purposes of applying any waiting period imposed under the State child health plan or the State plan under title XIX for the enrollment of the child under
such plan.
 ``(G) ASSURANCE OF SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD UNDER GROUP HEALTH PLANS IN CASE OF ELIGIBILITY FOR PREMIUM SUBSIDY ASSISTANCE.--No payment shall be made under subsection (a) for amounts expended for the provision of premium assistance subsidies under this paragraph unless a State provides assurances to the Secretary that the State has in effect laws requiring a group health plan, a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, and
a self-funded health plan, to permit an employee who is eligible, but not enrolled, for coverage under the terms of the plan (or a child of such an employee if the child is eligible, but not enrolled, for coverage under such terms) to enroll for coverage under the terms of the plan if the employee's child becomes eligible for a premium assistance subsidy under this paragraph.
 ``(H) NO EFFECT ON PREVIOUSLY APPROVED PREMIUM ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.--Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as limiting the authority of a State to offer premium assistance under section 1906, a waiver described in paragraph (2)(B) or (3), a waiver approved under section 1115, or other authority in effect on February 1, 2009.
 ``(I) NOTICE OF AVAILABILITY.--A State shall--
 ``(i) include on any application or enrollment form for child health assistance a notice of the availability of premium assistance subsidies for the enrollment of targeted low-income children in qualified employer sponsored coverage;
 ``(ii) provide, as part of the application and enrollment process under the State child health plan, information describing the availability of such subsidies and how to elect to obtain such a subsidy; and
 ``(iii) establish such other procedures as the State determines necessary to ensure that parents are informed of the availability of such subsidies under the State child health plan.''.
 (2) APPLICATION TO MEDICAID.--Section 1906 (42 U.S.C. 1396e) is amended by inserting after subsection (c) the following:
 ``(d) The provisions of section 2105(c)(12) shall apply to a child who is eligible for medical assistance under the State plan in the same manner as such provisions apply to a targeted low-income child under a State child health plan under title XXI. Section 1902(a)(34) shall not apply to a child who is provided a premium assistance subsidy under the State plan in accordance with the preceding sentence.''.
