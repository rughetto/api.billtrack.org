PART IX--CLARIFICATION OF REGULATIONS RELATED TO LIMITATIONS ON CERTAIN BUILT-IN LOSSES FOLLOWING AN OWNERSHIP CHANGE
SEC. 1281. CLARIFICATION OF REGULATIONS RELATED TO LIMITATIONS ON CERTAIN BUILT-IN LOSSES FOLLOWING AN OWNERSHIP CHANGE.
 (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:
 (1) The delegation of authority to the Secretary of the Treasury under section 382(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 does not authorize the Secretary to provide exemptions or special rules that are restricted to particular industries or classes of taxpayers.
 (2) Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008-83 is inconsistent with the congressional intent in enacting such section 382(m).
 (3) The legal authority to prescribe Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008-83 is doubtful.
 (4) However, as taxpayers should generally be able to rely on guidance issued by the Secretary of the Treasury legislation is necessary to clarify the force and effect of Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008-83 and restore the proper application under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 of the limitation on built-in losses following an ownership change of a bank.
 (b) Determination of Force and Effect of Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008-83 Exempting Banks From Limitation on Certain Built-in Losses Following Ownership Change.--

 (A) shall be deemed to have the force and effect of law with respect to any ownership change (as defined in section 382(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) occurring on or before January 16, 2009, and
 (B) shall have no force or effect with respect to any ownership change after such date.
 (2) BINDING CONTRACTS.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008-83 shall have the force and effect of law with respect to any ownership change (as so defined) which occurs after January 16, 2009, if such change--
 (A) is pursuant to a written binding contract entered into on or before such date, or
 (B) is pursuant to a written agreement entered into on or before such date and such agreement was described on or before such date in a public announcement or in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission required by reason of such ownership change.

 ``(B) The maximum incentive payment allowable under this subsection with respect to any State shall, as determined by the Secretary of Labor, be equal to the amount obtained by multiplying $7,000,000,000 by the same ratio as would apply under subsection (a)(2)(B) for purposes of determining such State's share of any excess amount (as described in subsection (a)(1)) that would have been subject to transfer to State accounts, as of October 1, 2008, under the provisions of subsection (a).
 ``(C) Of the maximum incentive payment determined under subparagraph (B) with respect to a State--
 ``(i) one-third shall be transferred to the account of such State upon a certification under paragraph (4)(B) that the State law of such State meets the requirements of paragraph (2); and
 ``(ii) the remainder shall be transferred to the account of such State upon a certification under paragraph (4)(B) that the State law of such State meets the requirements of paragraph (3).
 ``(2) The State law of a State meets the requirements of this paragraph if such State law--
 ``(A) uses a base period that includes the most recently completed calendar quarter before the start of the benefit year for purposes of determining eligibility for unemployment compensation; or
 ``(B) provides that, in the case of an individual who would not otherwise be eligible for unemployment compensation under the State law because of the use of a base period that does not include the most recently completed calendar quarter before the start of the benefit year, eligibility shall be determined using a base period that includes such calendar quarter.
 ``(3) The State law of a State meets the requirements of this paragraph if such State law includes provisions to carry out at least 2 of the following subparagraphs:
 ``(A) An individual shall not be denied regular unemployment compensation under any State law provisions relating to availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to accept work, solely because such individual is seeking only part-time (and not full-time) work, except that the State law provisions carrying out this subparagraph may exclude an individual if a majority of the weeks of work in such individual's base period do not include part-time work.
 ``(B) An individual shall not be disqualified from regular unemployment compensation for separating from employment if that separation is for any compelling family reason. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term `compelling family reason' means the following:
 ``(i) Domestic violence, verified by such reasonable and confidential documentation as the State law may require, which causes the individual reasonably to believe that such individual's continued employment would jeopardize the safety of the individual or of any member of the individual's immediate family (as defined by the Secretary of Labor).

Such programs shall prepare individuals who have been separated from a
declining occupation, or who have been involuntarily and indefinitely separated from employment as a result of a permanent reduction of operations at the individual's place of employment, for entry into a high-demand occupation. The amount of unemployment compensation payable under this subparagraph to an individual for a week of unemployment shall be equal to the individual's average
 weekly benefit amount (including dependents' allowances) for the most recent benefit year, and the total amount of unemployment compensation payable under this subparagraph to any individual shall be equal to at least 26 times the individual's average weekly benefit amount (including dependents' allowances) for the most recent benefit year.
 ``(D) Dependents' allowances are provided, in the case of any individual who is entitled to receive regular unemployment compensation and who has any dependents (as defined by State law), in an amount equal to at least $15 per dependent per week, subject to any aggregate limitation on such allowances which the State law may establish (but which aggregate limitation on the total allowance for dependents paid to an individual may not be less than $50 for each week of unemployment or 50 percent
of the individual's weekly benefit amount for the benefit year, whichever is less).
 ``(4)(A) Any State seeking an incentive payment under this subsection shall submit an application therefor at such time, in such manner, and complete with such information as the Secretary of Labor may within 60 days after the date of the enactment of this subsection prescribe (whether by regulation or otherwise), including information relating to compliance with the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3), as well as how the State intends to use the incentive payment to improve or strengthen the
State's unemployment compensation program. The Secretary of Labor shall, within 30 days after receiving a complete application, notify the State agency of the State of the Secretary's findings with respect to the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3) (or both).
 ``(B)(i) If the Secretary of Labor finds that the State law provisions (disregarding any State law provisions which are not then currently in effect as permanent law or which are subject to discontinuation) meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3), as the case may be, the Secretary of Labor shall thereupon make a certification to that effect to the Secretary of the Treasury, together with a certification as to the amount of the incentive payment to be transferred to the State account pursuant
to that finding. The Secretary of the Treasury shall make the appropriate transfer within 7 days after receiving such certification.
 ``(ii) For purposes of clause (i), State law provisions which are to take effect within 12 months after the date of their certification under this subparagraph shall be considered to be in effect as of the date of such certification.
 ``(C)(i) No certification of compliance with the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3) may be made with respect to any State whose State law is not otherwise eligible for certification under section 303 or approvable under section 3304 of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act.
 ``(ii) No certification of compliance with the requirements of paragraph (3) may be made with respect to any State whose State law is not in compliance with the requirements of paragraph (2).

 ``(B) A State may, subject to the same conditions as set forth in subsection (c)(2) (excluding subparagraph (B) thereof, and deeming the reference to `subsections (a) and (b)' in subparagraph (D) thereof to include this subsection), use any amount transferred to the account of such State under this subsection for the administration of its unemployment compensation law and public employment offices.
 ``(6) Out of any money in the Federal unemployment account not otherwise appropriated, the Secretary of the Treasury shall reserve $7,000,000,000 for incentive payments under this subsection. Any amount so reserved shall not be taken into account for purposes of any determination under section 902, 910, or 1203 of the amount in the Federal unemployment account as of any given time. Any amount so reserved for which the Secretary of the Treasury has not received a certification under paragraph
(4)(B) by the deadline described in paragraph (4)(C)(iii) shall, upon the close of fiscal year 2011, become unrestricted as to use as part of the Federal unemployment account.

such period.

An eligible professional shall not qualify as a Medicaid provider under this subsection unless the professional has waived, in a manner specified by the Secretary, any right to payment under section 1848(o) with respect to the adoption or support of certified EHR technology by the eligible professional. In applying clauses (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (B), the standards established by the Secretary for patient volume shall include individuals enrolled in a Medicaid managed care plan (under
section 1903(m) or section 1932).
 ``(3) In this subsection and subsection (a)(3)(F):
 ``(A) The term `certified EHR technology' means a qualified electronic health record (as defined in 3000(13) of the Public Health Service Act) that is certified pursuant to section 3001(c)(5) of such Act as meeting standards adopted under section 3004 of such Act that are applicable to the type of record involved (as determined by the Secretary, such as an ambulatory electronic health record for office-based physicians or an inpatient hospital electronic health record for hospitals).
 ``(B) The term `eligible professional' means a physician as defined in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 1861(r), and includes a nurse mid-wife and a nurse practitioner.
 ``(C) The term `hospital-based' means, with respect to an eligible professional, a professional (such as a pathologist, anesthesiologist, or emergency physician) who furnishes substantially all of the individual's professional services in a hospital setting (whether inpatient or outpatient) and through the use of the facilities and equipment, including qualified electronic health records, of the hospital.
 ``(4)(A) The term `allowable costs' means, with respect to certified EHR technology of a Medicaid provider, costs of such technology (and support services including maintenance and training that is for, or is necessary for the adoption and operation of, such technology) as determined by the Secretary to be reasonable.
 ``(B) The term `net allowable costs' means allowable costs reduced by any payment that is made to the Medicaid provider involved from any other source that is directly attributable to payment for certified EHR technology or services described in subparagraph (A).
 ``(C) In no case shall--
 ``(i) the aggregate allowable costs under this subsection (covering one or more years) with respect to a Medicaid provider described in paragraph (2)(A) for purchase and initial implementation of certified EHR technology (and services described in subparagraph (A)) exceed $25,000 or include costs over a period of longer than 5 years;
 ``(ii) for costs not described in clause (i) relating to the operation, maintenance, or use of certified EHR technology, the annual allowable costs under this subsection with respect to such a Medicaid provider for costs not described in clause (i) for any year exceed $10,000;
 ``(iii) payment described in paragraph (1) for costs described in clause (ii) be made with respect to such a Medicaid provider over a period of more than 5 years;
 ``(iv) the aggregate allowable costs under this subsection with respect to such a Medicaid provider for all costs exceed $75,000; or
 ``(v) the allowable costs, whether for purchase and initial implementation, maintenance, or otherwise, for a Medicaid provider described in paragraph (2)(B)(iii) exceed such aggregate or annual limitation as the Secretary shall establish, based on an amount determined by the Secretary as being adequate to adopt and maintain certified EHR technology, consistent with paragraph (6).
 ``(5) Payments described in paragraph (1) are not in accordance with this subsection unless the following requirements are met:
 ``(A) The State provides assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that amounts received under subsection (a)(3)(F) with respect to costs of a Medicaid provider are paid directly to such provider without any deduction or rebate.
 ``(B) Such Medicaid provider is responsible for payment of the costs described in such paragraph that are not provided under this title.
 ``(C) With respect to payments to such Medicaid provider for costs other than costs related to the initial adoption of certified EHR technology, the Medicaid provider demonstrates meaningful use of certified EHR technology through a means that is approved by the State and acceptable to the Secretary, and that may be based upon the methodologies applied under section 1848(o) or 1886(n). In establishing such means, which may include the reporting of clinical quality measures to the State, the
State shall ensure that populations with unique needs, such as children, are appropriately addressed.
 ``(D) To the extent specified by the Secretary, the certified EHR technology is compatible with State or Federal administrative management systems.
 ``(6)(A) In no case shall the payments described in paragraph (1), with respect to a hospital, exceed in the aggregate the product of--
 ``(i) the overall hospital EHR amount for the hospital computed under subparagraph (B); and
 ``(ii) the Medicaid share for such hospital computed under subparagraph (C).
 ``(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the overall hospital EHR amount, with respect to a hospital, is the sum of the applicable amounts specified in section 1886(n)(2)(A) for such hospital for the first 4 payment years (as estimated by the Secretary) determined as if the Medicare share specified in clause (ii) of such section were 1. The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register the overall hospital EHR amount for each hospital eligible for payments under this subsection. In computing
amounts under clause (ii) for payment years after the first payment year, the Secretary shall assume that in subsequent payment years discharges increase at the average annual rate of growth of the most recent three years for which discharge data are available.
 ``(C) The Medicaid share computed under this subparagraph, for a hospital for a period specified by the Secretary, shall be calculated in the same manner as the Medicare share under section 1886(n)(2)(D) for such a hospital and period, except that there shall be substituted for the numerator under clause (i) of such section the amount that is equal to the number of inpatient-bed-days (as established by the Secretary) which are attributable to individuals who are receiving medical assistance
under this title and who are not described in section 1886(n)(2)(D)(i). In computing inpatient-bed-days under the previous sentence, the Secretary shall take into account inpatient-bed-days attributable to inpatient-bed-days that are paid for individuals enrolled in a Medicaid managed care plan (under section 1903(m) or section 1932).
 ``(7) With respect to health care providers other than hospitals, the Secretary shall establish and implement a detailed process to ensure coordination of the different programs for payment of such health care providers for adoption or use of health information technology (including certified EHR technology), as well as payments for such health care providers provided under this title or title XVIII, to assure no duplication of funding. The Secretary shall promulgate regulations to carry out
the preceding sentence.
 ``(8) In carrying out paragraph (5)(C), the State and Secretary shall seek, to the maximum extent practicable, to avoid duplicative requirements from Federal and State Governments to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology under this title and title XVIII. In doing so, the Secretary may deem satisfaction of requirements for such meaningful use for a payment year under title XVIII to be sufficient to qualify as meaningful use under this subsection. The Secretary may also specify
the reporting periods under this subsection in order to carry out this paragraph.
 ``(9) In order to be provided Federal financial participation under subsection (a)(3)(F)(ii), a State must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that the State--
 ``(A) is using the funds provided for the purposes of administering payments under this subsection, including tracking of meaningful use by Medicaid providers;
 ``(B) is conducting adequate oversight of the program under this subsection, including routine tracking of meaningful use attestations and reporting mechanisms; and
 ``(C) is pursuing initiatives to encourage the adoption of certified EHR technology to promote health care quality and the exchange of health care information under this title, subject to applicable laws and regulations governing such exchange.
 ``(10) The Secretary shall periodically submit reports to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate on status, progress, and oversight of payments under paragraph (1).''.
 (b) Implementation Funding.--In addition to funds otherwise available, out of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, there are appropriated to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services Program Management Account, $40,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2009 through 2015 and $20,000,000 for each succeeding fiscal year through fiscal year 2018, which shall be available for purposes of carrying out the provisions of (and the
amendments made by) this part. Amounts appropriated under this subsection for a fiscal year shall be available until expended.
 (c) HHS Report on Implementation of Detailed Process to Assure No Duplication of Funding.--Not later than July 1, 2012, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall submit to Congress a report on the establishment and implementation of the detailed process under section 1903(t)(7) of the Social Security Act, as added by subsection (a), together with recommendations for such legislation and administrative action as the Secretary determines appropriate.
