SA 34. Mr. VITTER submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him  to the bill S. 181, to amend title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and to modify the operation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, to clarify that a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice that is unlawful under such Acts occurs each time compensation is paid pursuant to the discriminatory compensation decision
or other practice, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:


 At the appropriate place, insert the following:
SEC. __. GOVERNMENT NEUTRALITY IN CONTRACTING. 
 (a) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this section to--
 (1) promote and ensure open competition on Federal and federally funded or assisted construction projects;
 (2) maintain Federal Government neutrality towards the labor relations of Federal Government contractors on Federal and federally funded or assisted construction projects;
 (3) reduce construction costs to the Federal Government and to the taxpayers;
 (4) expand job opportunities, especially for small and disadvantaged businesses; and
 (5) prevent discrimination against Federal Government contractors or their employees based upon labor affiliation or the lack thereof, thereby promoting the economical, nondiscriminatory, and efficient administration and completion of Federal and federally funded or assisted construction projects.
 (b) Preservation of Open Competition and Federal Government Neutrality.--
 (1) PROHIBITION.--
 (A) GENERAL RULE.--The head of each executive agency that awards any construction contract after the date of enactment of this Act, or that obligates funds pursuant to such a contract, shall ensure that the agency, and any construction manager acting on behalf of the Federal Government with respect to such contract, in its bid specifications, project agreements, or other controlling documents does not--
 (i) require or prohibit a bidder, offeror, contractor, or subcontractor from entering into, or adhering to, agreements with 1 or more labor organization, with respect to that construction project or another related construction project; or
 (ii) otherwise discriminate against a bidder, offeror, contractor, or subcontractor because such bidder, offeror, contractor, or subcontractor--
 (I) became a signatory, or otherwise adhered to, an agreement with 1 or more labor organization with respect to that construction project or another related construction project; or
 (II) refused to become a signatory, or otherwise adhere to, an agreement with 1 or more labor organization with respect to that construction project or another related construction project.
 (B) APPLICATION OF PROHIBITION.--The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to contracts awarded prior to the date of enactment of this Act, and subcontracts awarded pursuant to such contracts regardless of the date of such subcontracts.
 (C) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.--Nothing in subparagraph (A) shall be construed to prohibit a contractor or subcontractor from voluntarily entering into an agreement described in such subparagraph.
 (2) RECIPIENTS OF GRANTS AND OTHER ASSISTANCE.--The head of each executive agency that awards grants, provides financial assistance, or enters into cooperative agreements for construction projects after the date of enactment of this Act, shall ensure that--
 (A) the bid specifications, project agreements, or other controlling documents for such construction projects of a recipient of a grant or financial assistance, or by the parties to a cooperative agreement, do not contain any of the requirements or prohibitions described in clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (1)(A); or
 (B) the bid specifications, project agreements, or other controlling documents for such construction projects of a construction manager acting on behalf of a recipient or party described in subparagraph (A) do not contain any of the requirements or prohibitions described in clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (1)(A).
 (3) FAILURE TO COMPLY.--If an executive agency, a recipient of a grant or financial assistance from an executive agency, a party to a cooperative agreement with an executive agency, or a construction manager acting on behalf of such an agency, recipient, or party, fails to comply with paragraph (1) or (2), the head of the executive agency awarding the contract, grant, or assistance, or entering into the agreement, involved shall take such action, consistent with law, as the head of the
agency determines to be appropriate.
 (4) EXEMPTIONS.--
 (A) IN GENERAL.--The head of an executive agency may exempt a particular project, contract, subcontract, grant, or cooperative agreement from the requirements of 1 or more of the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) if the head of such agency determines that special circumstances exist that require an exemption in order to avert an imminent threat to public health or safety or to serve the national security.
 (B) SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), a finding of ``special circumstances'' may not be based on the possibility or existence of a labor dispute concerning contractors or subcontractors that are nonsignatories to, or that otherwise do not adhere to, agreements with 1 or more labor organization, or labor disputes concerning employees on the project who are not members of, or affiliated with, a labor organization.
 (C) ADDITIONAL EXEMPTION FOR CERTAIN PROJECTS.--The head of an executive agency, upon application of an awarding authority, a recipient of grants or financial assistance, a party to a cooperative agreement, or a construction manager acting on behalf of any of such entities, may exempt a particular project from the requirements of any or all of the provisions of paragraphs (1) or (2) if the agency head finds--
 (i) that the awarding authority, recipient of grants or financial assistance, party to a cooperative agreement, or construction manager acting on behalf of any of such entities had issued or was a party to, as of the date of the enactment of this Act, bid specifications, project agreements, agreements with one or more labor organizations, or other controlling documents with respect to that particular project, which contained any of the requirements or prohibitions set forth in paragraph (1)(A);
and
 (ii) that one or more construction contracts subject to such requirements or prohibitions had been awarded as of the date of the enactment of this Act.
 (5) FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATORY COUNCIL.--With respect to Federal contracts to which this subsection applies, not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall take appropriate action to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to implement the provisions of this subsection.

 (A) CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT.--The term ``construction contract'' means any contract for the construction, rehabilitation, alteration, conversion, extension, or repair of buildings, highways, or other improvements to real property.
 (B) EXECUTIVE AGENCY.--The term ``executive agency'' has the meaning given such term in section 105 of title 5, United States Code, except that such term shall not include the Government Accountability Office.
 (C) LABOR ORGANIZATION.--The term ``labor organization'' has the meaning given such term in section 701(d) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e(d)).
